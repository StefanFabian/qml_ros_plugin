ImageTransport

Seeing what the robot sees is one of the most important features of any user interface.
To enable this, this library provides the :cpp:class:`ImageTransportSubscriber <qml_ros_plugin::ImageTransportSubscriber>`.
It allows easy subscription of camera messages and provides them in a QML native format as a VideoSource.

Example:

.. code-block:: qml

  ImageTransportSubscriber {
    id: imageSubscriber
    // Enter a valid image topic here
    topic: "/front_rgbd_cam/color/image_rect_color"
    // This is the default transport, change if compressed is not available
    defaultTransport: "compressed"
  }

  VideoOutput {
    anchors.fill: parent
    // Can be used in increments of 90 to rotate the video
    orientation: 90
    source: imageSubscriber
  }

The :cpp:class:`ImageTransportSubscriber <qml_ros_plugin::ImageTransportSubscriber>` can be used as the source of a
``VideoOutput`` to display the camera images as they are received.
Additionally, it can be configured to show a blank image after x milliseconds using the ``timeout`` property which is set
to 3000ms (3s) by default. This can be disabled by setting the ``timeout`` to 0.
If you do not want the full camera rate, you can throttle the rate by setting ``throttleRate`` to a value greater than 0
(which is the default and disables throttling). E.g. a rate of 0.2 would show a new frame every 5 seconds.
Since there is no ROS functionality for a throttled subscription, this means the ``image_transport::Subscriber`` is shut
down and newly subscribed for each frame. This comes at some overhead, hence, it should only be used to throttle to low
rates <1.
To avoid all throttled subscribers subscribing at the same time causing huge network spikes, the throttled rates are
load balanced by default. This can be disabled globally using
:cpp:func:`ImageTransportManager::setLoadBalancingEnabled <qml_ros_plugin::ImageTransportManagerSingletonWrapper::setLoadBalancingEnabled>`
which is available in QML using the singleton ``ImageTransportManager``.
